Our Automated product recommendation emails are personalized one to one messages with individual recommended products, based on each of your customer’s browsing behaviour, past purchases, and email clicks.

We automatically pull in all of your previous customer data from your WooCommerce store. Then we start tracking what your current visitors are clicking on, adding to cart, and buying.

Our emails use this data to make individual product recommendations for each of your customers. More relevant products means more chance they find something they want to buy.
